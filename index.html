            <h1>Mission</h1>
            <p>We connect you to the resources that help you pass your computer sciences classes at Tufts University.</p>
            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>This platform was created in 2020 by a Tufts CS students. After everything moved to online, 
                various professors adapted to the situation and introduced so many tools. After feeling overwhelmed, 
                our founder organized various resources that he found helpful when he was taking various cs class. 
                Therefore, he wanted to share them with Tufts community so that they don't have to go through the same
                tough experience he had.</p>
            <h2>Report</h2>
            <p>85% of Tufts students who used this website, reported that our services help them find most of resources 
                they need in order to get started with their courses. Sometimes it can be hard to keep up with all information
                listed on course websites and other platforms they use to communicate with students. 
                Therefore, that is why we started this platform to make the transtion smooth and fast for new students.</p>
