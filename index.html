            <h2>Report</h2>
            <p>85% of Tufts students who used this website, reported that our services help them find most of resources 
                they need in order to get started with their courses. Sometimes it can be hard to keep up with all information
                listed on course websites and other platforms they use to communicate with students. 
                Therefore, that is why we started this platform to make the transtion smooth and fast for new students.</p>
